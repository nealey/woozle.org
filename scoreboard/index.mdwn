Adding Your Logo
--------------

The scoreboard ships with a bunch of
[preinstalled team logos](logos.html),
including a rainbow of generic logos.

I would be happy to add your team's logo, too!
[Email me](mailto:neale@woozle.org) the largest copy you can find,
and I'll put it in.
SVG, WMF, or PNG files are best.

Please do this at least a week before your bout!
