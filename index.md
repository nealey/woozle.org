When the World Wide Web was sort of new,
back before "web 2.0",
Woozle was a place where people kept things
like email, homepages, blogs.
Now those things are all provided elsewhere,
and they're way better than anything Woozle ever had.

Some people still use this server
mostly for software development,
but there's nothing interesting left
to put on the front page.
So here is a photograph of a turtle:
