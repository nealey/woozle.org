8 Mar: More web server suckage
------------------------------

I'm trying to get woozle.org ready for IPv6, using the same software
we run in [Dirtbags CTF](http://dirtbags.net/ctf/).  I *thought* I had
the web server up and working, but apparently I broke webmail logins.

Thanks to the vigilant woozle user who phoned me to let me know it was
busted.

Uptime for the web server is pretty horrible lately.  My apologies.
