October 9: New Webmail
----------------------

The October 2 change broke webmail.  Again.  Rather than fix it again,
I thought everyone would enjoy a more modern webmail client.  You can
still get to [the old one](https://woozle.org/ilohamail.cgi) if you
want to pull your address book out or something, but I'm planning on
removing it in a few months unless someone asks me not to.

Mail filtering is now available.  You can
get to that under Settings.  This uses a standard filtering language,
so your filters will stick around if I have to change the webmail
program again.  These filters also apply to IMAP clients (like your
Android or iPhone, or Thunderbird).



October 2: Kerboom
------------------

In trying to get my 2006 cell phone to sync with Google Calendar, I broke
(among other things) mail.  I think it's all back up now.  If you see any
other problems, please give me a call.

I should mention that [eris HTTPd](http://woozle.org/~neale/src/eris.html)
was the only service that never went down; not even for a nanosecond.
