Title: LED Roller Derby Scoreboard

A do-it-yourself LED Roller Derby scoreboard.
It's visible in full sunlight,
doesn't use a computer at all,
and can be easily operated by an 8-year-old.

If you're looking for a software scoreboard (using a projector)
this isn't what you want.
But here's [a list of free scoreboard software](http://woozle.org/scoreboard/others.html) that should help.

This scoreboard is operated with a Nintendo controller,
and runs on an XBox 360 power supply.
The rest of the parts need to be ordered from various sources online.
The total should come out to around $200,
with plenty of options for upgrades.

It will take about 6 weeks of work,
and requires basic electronics understanding and
elementary soldering skills.
Neale provides updated firmware,
so unless you feel like modifying the MIT-licensed source code,
you don't need to do any programming.

Support

I highly recommend you join the

You will need help,
either because you get confused,
or because the instructions are crappy,
or both.
This group is where to go to get it.
