Title: LED Roller Derby Scoreboard

A do-it-yourself LED Roller Derby scoreboard.
It's visible in full sunlight,
doesn't use a computer at all,
and can be easily operated by an 8-year-old.

If you're looking for a software scoreboard (using a projector)
this [list of free derby scoreboard software](http://woozle.org/scoreboard/others.html) will help.

This scoreboard is operated with a Nintendo controller,
and runs on an XBox 360 power supply.
The rest of the parts need to be ordered from various sources online.
The total should come out to around $200,
with plenty of options for upgrades.

It will take about 6 weeks of work,
and requires basic electronics understanding and
elementary soldering skills.
I provide updated firmware,
so unless you feel like modifying the MIT-licensed source code,
you don't need to do any programming.
