Title: Nerds draw Birds

Once upon a time there was a nice lady who (we think) drew birds for
people.  She was so nice that a part of her body thought, "if some of
her is this nice, an infinite amount of her would be *really* nice!"
So it started to grow, and grow, and grow, and then it had to be
removed.  Now she's going to feel icky for a while.

We've decided to try and draw some birds for her because there's nothing
else we can do.

define(BURD, `<object data="$1" title="$2" style="max-width: 250px">$2</object>')
BURD(neale.png, Neale's bird is all set for winter or sumo wrestling.)
BURD(neale2.png, Neale's woodpecker seems to have had a botched lobotomy.)
BURD(cyclohexane-bird.png, deejoe used a chemistry CAD program.  I think this is H₆O₅C₃ and should be considered highly volatile.)
BURD(sarah.png, Sarah's bird can scale to poster size with NO PIXELLATION.)
BURD(nemo.png, nemo apparently doesn't understand what 'poorly-drawn' means.)
BURD(SpaceHobo.png, SpaceHobo's bird is cruisin' for a bruisin'.)
BURD(emad-finnix.jpg, SpaceHobo suggested this drawing by emad.  I think they both may be unclear on the concept.)
BURD(eythian.png, Eythian drew this beautiful anencephalic owl.)
