Title: Nerds draw Birds

Once upon a time there was a nice lady who drew birds for people.  She
was so nice that a part of her body thought, "if some of her is this
nice, an infinite amount of her would be *really* nice!"  So it
started to grow, and grow, and grow, and then it had to be removed.
Now she's going to feel icky for a while.

We've decided to try and draw some birds for her because there's nothing
else we can do.

BURD(neale.png, Neale's bird is all set for winter or sumo wrestling.)
BURD(neale2.png, Neale's woodpecker seems to have had a botched lobotomy.)
BURD(cyclohexane-bird.png, deejoe used a chemistry CAD program.  I think this is H₆O₅C₃ and should be considered highly volatile.)
BURD(sarah.png, Sarah's bird can scale to poster size with NO PIXELLATION.)
BURD(nemo.png, Nemo apparently doesn't understand what 'poorly-drawn' means.)
BURD(SpaceHobo.png, SpaceHobo's bird is cruisin' for a bruisin'.)
BURD(emad-finnix.jpg, SpaceHobo suggested this drawing by emad.  I think they both may be unclear on the concept.)
BURD(eythian.png, Eythian drew this beautiful anencephalic owl.)
BURD(emad.jpg, I can't tell if emad's drawing is a bird or a bird leg with legs.)
BURD(fondue.gif, Fondue's duck is furious that its iPad's touchscreen isn't usable with feathers.  You can't tell because ducks have no lips.)
BURD(sneakums.png, It looks kind and gentle but sneakums' bird would just as soon peck your eyes out as poop in your hair.)
BURD(rasher.png, HI GUYS HOW'S IT GOING DO YOU LIKE SEEDS by rasher)
